## What is PowerShell?

**PowerShell** is a powerful tool from Microsoft that combines three functionalities:

* **Command-line shell:** It provides an alternative way to interact with your computer using commands instead of a graphical interface.
* **Scripting language:** It allows you to automate tasks by writing scripts that perform specific actions, saving you time and effort.
* **Configuration management framework:** It helps you manage the configuration of your systems and applications, ensuring consistency and efficiency across your environment.

**Key points to remember:**

* **Cross-platform:** While originally designed for Windows, PowerShell is now available and functional on macOS and Linux as well.
* **Task automation:** Its primary strength lies in automating repetitive tasks, making it a valuable asset for system administrators, developers, and security professionals.
* **Flexibility:** It offers a wide range of features and functionalities, making it adaptable to various use cases.
