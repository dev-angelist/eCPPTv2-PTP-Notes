#### DVWA

**The Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)** is a web application built with PHP and MySQL intentionally designed to be susceptible to security vulnerabilities. Its primary purpose is to serve as a resource for security professionals to assess their skills and tools within a legal context. Additionally, it aids web developers in gaining a deeper understanding of the processes involved in securing web applications and facilitates learning about web application security for both students and teachers in a controlled classroom setting.

DVWA is designed to provide a platform for practicing various common web vulnerabilities at different difficulty levels, all presented through a simple and user-friendly interface. It's important to note that there are deliberate both documented and undocumented vulnerabilities within the software, encouraging users to explore and identify as many issues as possible.
