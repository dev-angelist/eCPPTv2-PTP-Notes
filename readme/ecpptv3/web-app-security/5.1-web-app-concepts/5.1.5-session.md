# 5.1.5 Session

## Session

Web developers sometimes opt to store information on the server side rather than the client side. This decision is motivated by a desire to conceal application logic and to minimize the back-and-forth data transmission, a characteristic behavior of cookies. HTTP sessions provide a straightforward mechanism that enables websites to store variables specific to a given visit on the server side. Each user session is uniquely identified by either a session ID or token, assigned by the server.

### **Session vs Cookies**

* **Storage Location:**
  * Cookies are stored on the client side.
  * Session variables are stored on the server side.
* **Expiration:**
  * Cookies can have a longer lifespan and persist even after the browser is closed.
  * Session variables expire with the session, usually sooner than cookies.

### **Session Mechanism**

* **Session Token (or Session ID):**
  * Assigned by the web server to the client.
  * Presented by the client in subsequent requests to be recognized.
  * Acts as a primary key to retrieve client state and associated variables on the server.

## **Session Cookies**

* Contain a single parameter in a key-value pair format.
* Examples: `SESSION=0wvCbOBWDH8w`, `PHPSESSID=13An5Z6Uo4pH`, `JSESSIONID=W7DPUBgw7kTM`.
* Session IDs can be stored in text files, databases, or server memory.

### **Session Cookie Installation:**

* Servers can install session cookies after specific client activities, like logging in or opening a page.
* The browser includes the session cookie in subsequent requests.
* Session cookies help maintain variables, reducing bandwidth usage.

#### **Session Cookie Example:**

* The client uses a login form, and the server responds with a Set-Cookie header containing the session ID.
* The browser includes the session cookie in subsequent requests.
* Any subsequent request carries the session cookie, allowing the server to recognize the client.

#### **Alternative:**

* Session IDs can be sent via the GET method appended to the URL.
* Example: `http://example.site/resource.php?sessid=k27qds7h1w`.
