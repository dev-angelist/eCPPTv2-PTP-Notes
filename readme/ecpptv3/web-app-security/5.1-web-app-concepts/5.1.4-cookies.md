# 5.1.4 Cookies

## **Cookies**

In 1994, cookies were introduced to make HTTP stateful, overcoming its inherent statelessness. Cookies are text fragments stored by a web browser, primarily used for maintaining user state between HTTP requests. The key components of a cookie include:

*   **Domain:** Specifies the domain for which the cookie is valid. It can be a specific domain or a broader domain, including subdomains. A leading dot is ignored, and if not specified, the browser sets it to the server's domain. E.g., A website can only set sets a cookie for the domain: `google.com` or `.google.com`. This means that the browser will install the cookie in the cookie jar and will send this cookie for any subsequent request to `google.com`, `www.google.com`, and `maps.google.com`.

    The scope of this cookie will be `*.google.com`.&#x20;
* **Expires:** Sets a time constraint on the cookie. Session cookies expire when the session ends.
*   **Path:** Specifies the requests within the domain for which the browser should send the cookie.&#x20;

    &#x20;For cookies with path=`/downloads`, all subsequent requests to:

    * `/downloads`
    * `/downloads/foo`
    * `/downloads/foo/bar` will include this cookie. The browser will not send this cookie for requests to `/blog` or `/members`
*   **Content:** A cookie can carry multiple values simultaneously. A sever can set multiple values with a single `Set-Cookie` header by specifying multiple `KEY=Value` pairs.

    For example: `Set-Cookie: Username="john"; Authenticated="1"`
* **HTTP Only Flag:** Ensures the browser sends the cookie only through HTTP, preventing access via non-HTML technologies like JavaScript, Flash, or Java, protecting against XSS attacks.
* **Secure Flag:** Restricts the cookie to be sent only through HTTPS, enhancing security by preventing transmission in clear text.

### **Cookies Domain**

The `domain` attribute plays a crucial role in determining the validity of a cookie. It, along with `path`, `secure`, and `expires` attributes, helps decide if a cookie should be submitted with a new HTTP request. RFC6265 distinguishes cookies set with a specified domain value from those without.

A cookie with a specified domain value will be sent if the cookie domain matches the target domain or is a suffix of the target domain.

* Example 1: Cookie domain value = els.ptp.site, and the target domain is els.ptp.site. The cookie will be sent.
* Example 2: Cookie domain value = ptp.site, and the target domain is els.ptp.site. The cookie will be sent because ptp.site is a suffix of els.ptp.site.

Security Implications: Lower-level subdomains can set cookies for higher domains, but the reverse is not true.

### **Unspecified Cookie Domain**

A cookie without a specified domain value assumes the host-only flag is set to true.

* Example: If a cookie is set by a page on elsptp.site without a domain value, it will be sent only to requests matching http\[s]://elsptp.site/\*.

#### **Internet Explorer Exception**

* Internet Explorer does not distinguish between cookies with specified and unspecified domain values. It interprets cookies without a domain value as if they had a domain corresponding to the target domain set in it.

#### **Inspecting the Cookie Protocol**

The process of cookie installation involves the following steps:

1. **Login:** A login page is where a session begins, and a cookie is installed in the browser.
2. **POST /login.php:** The website responds with a Set-Cookie header containing the cookie details.
3. **Cookie:** For subsequent requests, the browser includes the cookie in the Request header.

### **Cookie Installation Examples**

#### **Correct Cookie Installation**

* **Example 1:** Cookie without a domain value is sent by the web server and accepted by the browser. The cookie is available only to the target domain a.elsptp.site.
* **Example 2:** Cookie with domain value .elsptp.site is sent, accepted, and sent in requests to matching URLs.
* **Example 3:** Cookie without a domain value and with the path /learning is sent and accepted, available only to the target domain a.elsptp.site and path /learning.
* **Example 4:** Two different cookies are accepted and stored by the browser without interfering with each other.

#### **Incorrect Cookie Installation**

The browser rejects a cookie with the domain value b.elsptp.site, as it is not a suffix of the domain a.elsptp.site that sent the cookie.
