# 5.2.8 Shodan HQ

## Shodan HQ

Shodan HQ is a specialized search engine that differs from traditional ones like Google, Yahoo, or Bing. Instead of crawling web pages, Shodan scans the entire Internet and collects information from banners by interrogating ports. This approach allows it to focus on various protocols, including HTTP(S), SSH, SNMP, MySQL/MongoDB, RDP, FTP, Telnet, and more.

#### **Shodan Search Capabilities**

Shodan can be utilized to:

* Identify devices with default usernames and passwords.
* View the configuration of a device.
* Detect server versions and much more.

#### **Boolean Operators and Filters**

Shodan supports Boolean operators and filters, enabling users to refine search results. Some useful filters include:

* **\[before/after] day/month/year:** Search for data collected before or after a specific date.
* **hostname:** Filter results for hosts that contain a specific value in their hostname.
* **port:** Narrow the search for specific services.
* **OS:** Search for devices with a specific operating system.

#### **Example Searches**

Suppose you want to find all devices running Apache in Italy (IT):

```sh
shCopy codeapache country:IT
```

This search provides a list of matching devices, and clicking on "Details" offers more in-depth information about a particular host.

### **Additional Tips**

* Shodan requires an account for advanced features and filters.
* Experiment with refining searches based on hostname, ports, and other criteria.
* Explore the tool to grasp its full capabilities and potential applications.

Shodan HQ serves as a powerful resource for cybersecurity professionals and researchers, offering unique insights into the online landscape by focusing on device banners and protocols.
